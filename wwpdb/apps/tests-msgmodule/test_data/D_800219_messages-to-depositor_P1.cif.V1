;Dear Depositors,

Thank you for depositing your structure, PDB ID 0303 and Deposition ID D_800219, with the wwPDB.

Entry title:   Structure of Pentavalent Phosphorous Intermediate of an Enzyme Catalyzed Phosphoryl transfer Reaction observed on cocrystallization with Glucose 1-phosphate

Entry authors:   Cat, T.

wwPDB encourage depositors to provide ORCID identifiers and information on relevant grants funding their research when
depositing PDB data. ORCID identifiers are unique to each researcher; usage will help avoid ambiguity in attributing
the correct authorship of PDB, BMRB, and EMDB entries. In order to register an ORCID, please visit http://orcid.org.

Please review the processed files and validation report in PDF format  based on the recommendations of the
wwPDB Validation Task Force. We encourage you to submit it to journals during manuscript review. If you have
any corrections, please send a message through the communication system requesting that we open the deposition
interface for you to upload new coordinates and make any changes.

From July 1st 2019, coordinate files will only be accepted in mmCIF format for structures determined by crystallographic
methods (X-ray, neutron, fiber, and electron diffraction). PDB format files will no longer be accepted from this date.

Some major issues were raised during data processing which must be resolved prior to release of the file. The
outstanding issues are summarized below. All correspondence for revisions including revised coordinates, and/or
supporting data factor files should be uploaded and resubmitted through the deposition interface.

Outstanding Issues:


1. Chirality Error

Chirality errors in your coordinates have been indicated in section 5.1 (Standard geometry) or 5.4 (nonstandard
residues in protein, DNA, RNA chains) or 5.6 (Ligand geometry) in the PDF validation report. These errors are
highlighted in the database_PDB_caveat section of the coordinate CIF file.

G16 A 1301 HAS WRONG CHIRALITY AT ATOM C1

Please upload new coordinates to resolve this issue.



In addition, please verify the following:


2. Sequence

Please verify that the sample sequence in the entity_poly section of the coordinate CIF file includes all
residues used in the experiment including expression tags and residues missing due to disorder.


3. Assembly

Assembly 1 provided by the author contains:
1 copy of chain A

Please login to your deposition session and visit the Assembly Review page to verify the annotated assemblies in 3D.


4. Ligand Identity

The following chemical group exists in your deposition. Please review section 2 of the validation report
(Entry composition) to verify ligand chemistry.

ID:      G16
Name:    1,6-di-O-phosphono-alpha-D-glucopyranose
Synonym: ALPHA-D-GLUCOSE 1,6-BISPHOSPHATE; 1,6-di-O-phosphono-alpha-D-glucose; 1,6-
di-O-phosphono-D-glucose; 1,6-di-O-phosphono-glucose
Formula: C6 H13 O12 P2

ID:      MG
Name:    MAGNESIUM ION
Formula: Mg


5. Fit of model to data RSR Z-score

Section 6 (Fit of model and data) of the validation report indicates a number of RSR-Z outliers in an electron
density map calculated from your data. Please examine these outliers.

RSRZ outliers:
Molecule  Chain ID  Res Num  Res Name    RSRZ
      1        A      1220      GLN    11.142

6. Distant Waters

Water molecules that are more than 5 Angstrom away from the nearest non-solvent hydrogen-bonding partner are
listed below. Please review these potentially distant waters, and revisit those that do not belong to a second,
third, etc. solvation shells (bound to other waters).
