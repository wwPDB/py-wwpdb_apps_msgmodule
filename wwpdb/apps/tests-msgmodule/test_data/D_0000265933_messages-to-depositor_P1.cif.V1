;Dear Depositors,

Thank you for depositing your structure, PDB ID XXXX and Deposition ID D_0000265933, with the wwPDB.

Entry title:   Structure of ABC

Entry authors:   Cat, T.

wwPDB encourage depositors to provide ORCID identifiers and information on relevant grants funding their research when
depositing PDB data. ORCID identifiers are unique to each researcher; usage will help avoid ambiguity in attributing
the correct authorship of PDB, BMRB, and EMDB entries. In order to register an ORCID, please visit http://orcid.org.

Please log into your deposition session and review the processed files and validation report in PDF format
generated based on the recommendations of the wwPDB Validation Task Force. The processed files are located
below this message on Communication page of your deposition session. We encourage you to submit the validation
report to journals during manuscript review. If you have any corrections, please send a message through the
communication page requesting that we open the deposition interface for you to upload new coordinates and/or
make any changes.

No major issues were raised during data processing. A summary of some of the key annotations in your entry is
shown below. Please verify that these are correct. If we do not hear from you within three weeks, we will consider
this entry to have been approved by you. The entry will then be released according to the release/hold instructions
you have provided.

Summary:


1. Sequence

Please verify that the sample sequence in the entity_poly section of the coordinate CIF file includes all
residues used in the experiment including expression tags and residues missing due to disorder.


2. Assembly

Assembly 1 provided by the author and predicted by PISA contains:
1 copy of chain A
1 copy of chain B
1 copy of chain F
1 copy of chain G

Please login to your deposition session and visit the Assembly Review page to verify the annotated assemblies in 3D.


3. Oligosaccharide

Please note that your oligosacccharide ligand has been split into oligomer of monosaccharide in one chain of branched entity. This process is applied to the entire PDB archive for data format standardization. For more information, please refer to  Shao, e. al., 2021
Glycobiology
2021 Sep 20;31(9):1204-1218.
